Manual curation of electrophysiology spike sorted units is slow, laborious, and hard to standardize and reproduce. Bombcell is a powerful toolbox that addresses this problem. It programatically evaluates the quality of recorded units and also extract essential electrophysiological properties.

Bombcell is specifically tailored for units recorded with Neuropixels probes (3A, 1.0, and 2.0) using SpikeGLX or OpenEphys and spike-sorted with Kilosort. If you want to use bombcell in conjunction with another spike sorting algorithm, please raise a [github issue](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/issues), create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or email [us](mailto:julie.mfabre@gmail.com).

### üìî Bombcell wiki

Documentation and guides to using and troubleshooting bombcell can be found on the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/wiki).

### üèÅ Quick start guide

#### Overview

Bombcell extracts relevant quality metrics to categorize units into four categories: single somatic units, multi-units, noise units and non-somatic units.

Take a look at [`bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline`](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline.m) to see an example workflow.

#### Installation

To begin using Bombcell:
- [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/bombcell) and the [dependancies](#Dependancies).
- add bombcell's and the dependancies' folders to [MATLAB's path](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pathtool.html).
- in addition, if you want to compute ephys properties, change your working directory to `bombcell\ephysProperties\helpers` in matlab and run `mex -O CCGHeart.c` to able to compute fast ACGs, using a script written by Micha√´l Zugaro.

#### Dependancies

- https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab (to load .npy data in).
- If you have z-lib compressed ephys data, compressed with [mtscomp](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/mtscomp), you will additionally need the [zmat toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71434-zmat). More information about compressing ephys data [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/05/24/2023.05.22.541700.full.pdf?%3Fcollection=). 
- to compute fast ACGs, we use a function written by Micha√´l Zugaro, and it is already included in bombcell.
