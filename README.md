# bombcell

Quality metrics for neuropixels data, used in Peters et al., 2021 to get some bombshell cells! 

## Used in Peters et al., 2021

### quality metrics 

#### number of spikes 

minimum number of spikes over recording. The minimum was set to 300 empircally, and because Kilosort2 does not attempt to split any clusters that have less than 300 spikes in the post-processing phase. 

#### refractory period violations

#### spikes missing 

#### somatic

#### amplitude 

### ephys properties 

#### post spike suppresssion 

#### waveform duration

#### proportion long ISIs
